           <h4 id="Lion"> The Lion</h4>
           <br>
          <span <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa
     and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round
     ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
     adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
     It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride
     consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
      lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion
      is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when 
     opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species
      typically does not.
    The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more 
     diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active
     at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged
     throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and Western and
     South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan
      Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable
       on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries
        have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are 
        untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the 
        decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
         are the greatest causes for concern.
            
    One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion 
     has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags,
     and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in
      menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species
     sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the
      late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient
       Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval 
        cultures in the lion's historic and current range.</p>

         <h4 id="Tiger"> The Tiger</h4>
           <br>
          <span <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
               It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex 
               predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally 
               a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements
                for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become
                 independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

            The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in
             the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in 
             the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic 
             range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas
              of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian 
              temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra.
            
            The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was 
            estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small
             isolated pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline
              are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife
               conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density.
            
            The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured
             prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues
              to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for
               sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.</p>
